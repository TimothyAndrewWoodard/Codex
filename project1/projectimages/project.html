        <h2>The first stage of the game the beginner must
             master to lay his foundation is the engame.</h2>

                The most fundamental endgame principal is that of opposition of the kings
                after all of the other pices have been traded and we are down to a King and 
                pawn versus king. Find the winning move.

                Another fundamental endgame concept is that of zugzwang. This is when
                you deprive your opponent of any useful, or even acceptable move, and force
                him to make a move that damages his position.

        <div class = "blue-box"> This puzzle comes from a game played by yours truly in Class A 
            at the world open. There were thousands of dollars riding on this game. I ended
            up winning around four grand but my opponent could have won that if he had a better 
            understanding of basic endgame principals and had found the correct move that leads 
            to a forced win. This puzzle also illustrates the principal of zugzwang as well as the principal
            of distraction.
