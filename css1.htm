    <h2>The basic principals beginner chess players should learn are as follows, in sequential order</h2>

    <div class="box blue-box" id = '3' >
      <h1 id="fundamentalcheckmate">Basic Checkmates</h1>
      <p>
        The first thing any chess player needs to master after learning the
        rules of the game, are the basic checkamtes. The most basic is King and
        Queen versus King. After that comes King and Rook versus King.
      </p>

    <div class="box blue-box">
      <h2>More advanced checkmates</h2>
      <p>
        Sometimes a player has drawing possibilities by trading off his pieces
        for your pawns. So learnging how to checkmate with two bishops or two
        knights can be helpful
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class = "box blue-box">
    <h1>Basic King and Pawn endings</h1>
    <p>
      Beginner chess players should focus first on a board with only a few
      pieces.
